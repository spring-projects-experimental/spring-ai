= Spring AI API

== Introduction

The Spring AI API covers a wide range of functionalities.
Each major feature is detailed in its own dedicated section.
To provide an overview, the following key functionalities are available:

=== AI Model API

Portable `Model API` across AI providers for `Chat`, `Text to Image`, `Audio Transcription`, `Text to Speech`, and `Embedding` models.
Both `synchronous` and `stream` API options are supported.
Dropping down to access model specific features is also supported.

=== Vector Store API

Portable `Vector Store API` across multiple providers, including a novel `SQL-like metadata filter API` that is also portable. Support for 14 vector databases are available.

=== Function Calling API

`Function calling`. Spring AI makes it easy to have the AI model invoke your POJO `java.util.Function` object.

Check the Spring AI xref::api/functions.adoc[Function Calling] documentation.

=== Auto Configuration

Spring Boot Auto Configuration and Starters for AI Models and Vector Stores.

=== ETL Data Engineering

ETL framework for Data Engineering.  This provides the basis of loading data into a vector database, helping implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern that enables you to bring your data to the AI model to incorporate into its response.
